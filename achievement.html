        <h3>🌸 Class Monitor Recognition</h3>
        <p>Served as the class monitor for Form 5 Tulip (2022–2023). Successfully carried out leadership duties, managed class matters, and supported my classmates, all while juggling the pressure of SPM. It was truly exhausting 😮‍💨, but it taught me valuable lessons in resilience, time management, and leading with heart. Despite the challenges, it became one of my most meaningful memories, and I felt truly appreciated.</p>

        <h3>🚗 Passed My Driving Test – A Dream Come True</h3>
	<p>
	Honestly, I still can’t believe I passed my driving test! This has been a dream of mine since I was a kid. If 10-year-old me could see 20-year-old me behind the wheel today, she'd be screaming with joy. I'm beyond proud of this milestone because it reminds me that with  patience (and a lot of practice!), dreams really do come true.
